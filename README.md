Ricardo works for AWS in the developer relations team. The world of Developer Relations (DevRel) is his current passion. Even before doing DevRel as a full-time job at companies like [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), it was a hobby for him at previous companies. Ricardo's approach to DevRel is unique. He prides himself on being heavily technical to amaze developers with deep dives and core software engineering, instead of focusing on debatably useful beginner content. To him, the content may be advanced. But the messaging and the storytelling are what must be kept at the beginner's level.

With +20 years of experience, he built an extensive background in distributed systems, messaging, databases, and observability. The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his primary focus was about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and development best practices. Then, he spent another 10 years working as a solution architect in companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com).
