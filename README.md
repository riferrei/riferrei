### About Me

Ricardo is Observability Lead for Elastic's community team, where he acts as the voice of [Elastic](https://elastic.co) at SRE, DevOps, and DataOps communities. In this role, he is responsible for developing and driving a global community and developer advocacy strategy focused on observability. With +20 years of experience, he may have learned a thing or two about distributed systems, fast data analytics, software architecture, databases, and observability. Before joining Elastic, he worked for other vendors such as [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com), and [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com).

While not working, he loves barbecuing in his backyard with his family and friends, where he finally gets the chance to talk about anything unrelated to computers. He currently lives in North Carolina, USA, with his wife and son. Follow Ricardo on Twitter: [@riferrei](https://twitter.com/riferrei)
