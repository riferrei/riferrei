Ricardo works for AWS in the Developer Experience team. The world of DevRel (Developer Relations) is his current passion. Even before doing DevRel as a full-time job at companies like [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)—it was a hobby for him at previous companies. Ricardo's approach to DevRel is quite unique. He prides himself on being heavily technical to amaze developers with deep dives on core software engineering, instead of focusing only on beginner content. To him, the content may be advanced. But the messaging and the storytelling are what must be kept at the beginner's level.

With +24 years of experience, he developed an extensive background in distributed systems, databases, streaming data, and observability. The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his primary focus was about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and development best practices. Then, he spent another 10 years working as a Solution Architect in companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com). With Oracle, he was a member of "The A-Team" — a special team under the product development organization whose charter is engage in highly complicated projects and complete them successfully. Therefore, don't take it the wrong way if Ricardo finds that difficult project of yours a piece of cake.
