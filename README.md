Ricardo is a Senior Developer Advocate at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), working in the developer relations team for North America. The world of developer relations is his current passion. This is something he had always cherished for; but officially started doing it when he joined open source based startups like [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) and [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io). Having experienced implementing developer relations programs from the ground up granted him an acute sense of what successful strategies are worth pursuing and what mistakes to avoid.

With +20 years of experience, he built an extensive background in distributed systems, messaging, fast data analytics, databases, and observability. He spent the first 10 years of his career in software engineering, where his life was all about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and development best practices. Then, he spent other 10 years in customer facing roles working with solution architecture in large companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com).
