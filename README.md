A software engineer by career, problem solver by heart, and developer relations professional by vocation. With +24 years of experience, Ricardo developed an extensive background in distributed systems, databases, streaming data, and observability.

The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his focus was on code efficiency, compilers, debuggers, programming languages, and development best practices. Then, Ricardo switched gears, working with Solution Architecture at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com). There, he was a member of the "A-Team" â€” a special team under the product development organization whose charter is to engage in highly complicated projects and complete them successfully.

Eventually, Ricardo realized how much being great with code, building long-lasting relationships, and with teaching is a rare combination. This is how he ended up working with DevRel (Developer Relations) at companies like [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).
