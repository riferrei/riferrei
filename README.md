Ricardo works for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) in the developer relations team. The world of developer relations is his current passion. After doing it as a hobby for +10 years, it became his full-time job after joining open source-based startups like [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io) and [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co). Having experienced implementing developer relations programs from the ground up in these companies granted him an acute sense of what successful strategies are worth pursuing, and the ones to avoid.

With +20 years of experience, he built an extensive background in distributed systems, messaging, databases, and observability. The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his primary focus was about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and development best practices. Then, he spent another 10 years working as a solution architect in companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com).
