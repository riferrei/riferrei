### About Me

Ricardo is Senior Developer Advocate at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), working in the developer relations team for North America. With +20 years of experience, he may have learned a thing or two about distributed systems, messaging, fast data analytics, databases, and observability. Before AWS, he worked for software vendors like [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/), and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com). Ricardo is known for his uncanny ability to explain complex topics. He craftily breaks them down into bite-sized pieces until anyone can understand.

While not working, he loves barbecuing in his backyard with his family and friends, where he finally gets the chance to talk about anything unrelated to computers. He currently lives in North Carolina, USA, with his wife and son. Follow Ricardo on Twitter: [@riferrei](https://twitter.com/riferrei).
