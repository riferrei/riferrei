### About Me

Ricardo is observability lead for Elastic's community team, where he acts as the voice of [Elastic](https://elastic.co) at SRE, DevOps, and DataOps communities. He is responsible for developing and driving a global community strategy focused on observability. With +20 years of experience, he might have learned a thing or two about distributed systems, observability, streaming systems, and databases. Before Elastic, he worked for other vendors such as [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com), [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), and different consulting firms.

While not working, he loves barbecuing in his backyard with his family and friends, where he gets the chance to talk about anything that is not IT-related. He lives in North Carolina, USA, with his wife and son. Follow Ricardo on Twitter: [@riferrei](https://twitter.com/riferrei)
