Ricardo works for AWS in the Developer Experience team. The world of DevRel (Developer Relations) is Ricardo's second nature. Even before working with DevRel as a full-time job at companies like [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)—it was like a hobby for him during his software engineering days. Ricardo's approach to DevRel is unique. He prides himself on being heavily technical to amaze developers with deep dives on core software engineering, instead of focusing only on beginner content. To him, the content may be advanced. But the messaging and the storytelling are what we must keep at the beginner's level so anyone can understand.

With +24 years of experience, he developed an extensive background in distributed systems, databases, streaming data, and observability. The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his primary focus was about programming languages, compilers, debuggers, code efficiency, and development best practices. Then, he switched gears, working with Solution Architecture at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com). There, he eventually joined the "A-Team" — a special team under the product development organization whose charter is engage in highly complicated projects and complete them successfully. Therefore, don't take it the wrong way if Ricardo finds that difficult project of yours a piece of cake.
