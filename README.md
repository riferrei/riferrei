Ricardo is a Senior Developer Advocate at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), working in the developer relations team for North America. The world of developer relations is his current passion, something he started off by working at open-source based startups such as [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) and [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io).

With +20 years of experience, he built an extensive background in distributed systems, fast data analytics, software architecture, databases, and observability. He spent the first 10 years of his career working with software engineering; then another 10 years with solution architecture in large companies like [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com), to broaden his knowledge beyond the realm of coding.

Ricardo is widely known for two things. First, by his uncanny ability to explain complex topics. He craftily breaks them down into bite-sized pieces until anyone can understand. Second, to see logic and patterns amidst chaos. He excels at keeping himself centered while everybody else is falling into despair. With that said, he likely won't add much value to well-established organizations where everything and everybody just works.
