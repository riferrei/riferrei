### About Me

Ricardo is Principal Developer Advocate ðŸ¥‘ at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co)â€”the company behind the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash), where he does community advocacy for North America. With +20 years of experience, he may have learned a thing or two about Distributed Systems, Observability, Streaming Systems, and Databases. Before Elastic, he worked for other vendors such as [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com), [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com), and different consulting firms. These days Ricardo spends most of his time making developers fall in love with technology.

While not working, he loves barbecuing in his backyard with his family and friends, where he gets the chance to talk about anything that is not IT-related. He lives in North Carolina, USA, with his wife and son. Follow Ricardo on Twitter: [@riferrei](https://twitter.com/riferrei)
