A software engineer by career, problem solver by heart, and developer relations professional by vocation. With +24 years of experience, Ricardo developed an extensive background in distributed systems, databases, streaming data, and observability. The first 10 years of his career were spent in software engineering, where his focus was on code efficiency, compilers, debuggers, programming languages, and development best practices. Then, Ricardo switched gears, working with Solution Architecture at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com). There, he was a member of the "A-Team" â€” a special team under the product development organization whose charter is to engage in highly complicated projects and complete them successfully. Eventually, he realized that he is great with code and people. This is how Ricardo ended up working with developer relations at [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com).
